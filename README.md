# Password Generator - Javascript Assignment

This assignment required me to create an application which would allow a user to create a random password based on the following selections/parameters:

- Password length of 8-128 characters
- choice to include:<br>
    -upper case letters<br>
    -lower case letters<br>
    -numbers<br>
    -special characters

I completed this assignment with starter code which included the html, css, and javascript files. However, I only had to modify the javascript files in order to complete the assignment.
